# LaneDetection

> This repository show a Lane Detection pipeline part of a Lane Departure Warning System, through the implementation of a computer vision pipeline strategy to detect lane lines in roads.
The real gain is that the algorithm parameters can be calibrated on the fly, making it possible to do fine-tuning, and map supervised different image/video datasets.
